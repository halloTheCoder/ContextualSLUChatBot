# ContextualSLU: Multi-Turn Spoken/Natural Language Understanding


*A Keras implementation of the models described in [Chen et al. (2016)] (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/doc/IS16_ContextualSLU.pdf).*

This model implements a memory network architecture for multi-turn understanding, 
where the history utterances are encoded as vectors and stored into memory cells for the current utterance's attention to improve slot tagging.

## Requirements
1. Python
2. Numpy `pip install numpy`
3. Keras and associated Theano or TensorFlow `pip install keras`
4. H5py `pip install h5py`

## Dataset
Consists of two datasets derieved from **Simulated-Google Restaurant dataset**

- **Dataset without acts** : Only take present utterance intent and slot
- **Datset with acts** : Take present utterance intent, slot and user_act.


## Getting Started
You can train and test JointSLU with the following commands:

```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/halloTheCoder/ContextualSLUChatBot.git
  cd ContextualSLUChatBot
```

## Model Running
Points to consider while running
- Give pretrained-embeddings as ![ConceptNet Numberbatch](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch), other will lead to error.
- Change data directories in `sequence_tagger.py`, by default **dataset without acts**. (NOTE :: Don't use **dataset folder as acts is not handled in code for now**)

```shell
	python sequence_tagger.py

```
